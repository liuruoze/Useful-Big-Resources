The "simple64_replays.7z" contains 60 replays played on the map Simple64. The player uses the Protoss race (played by an expert), and the built-in bot uses the Terran race. We collected these replays for supervised learning (or called behavior cloning) for the supervised learning part in the mini-AlphaStar project. Please use all these replays and a 1e-4 learning rate to train 10 epochs to get the results (showed by the GIFs) provided on the main page of the mini-AlphaStar project. 

Please use 7-Zip (a file unzip software, which has a much higher compression rate than the normal Zip software) to unzip this replay pack.

An additional 30 more replays are placed at our repository HierNet-SC2 (https://github.com/liuruoze/HierNet-SC2/tree/main/data/replay) now!

Please use all the 60 + 30 = 90 replays for training!
